Sharing code between plugins.
In develop, core library is linked between the projects. Fresh is the main, and others link includes/core to fresh.
In runtime - wp-setting loads the plugins. Core libraries appear in each of them. require_once doesn't helps. We'll check
!class_exists (or function_exists).

Args:
=-=-=
Args() - gets the type of displayed type and sets the args for that type.
The functions that call core/gem preset args using Args. The can get args from the caller - only effective for non object
parameters like post_file, page, etc.
Args used by Core to affect display of controls, data rows, etc.

Robot: Running scripts given from the user:
+ Random users can trigger the robot. More users will make the robot run more times. Non active server when be triggered to run the robot.
+ No users: no need for the data to be updated.
Javascript or PHP as the trigger? Keep it simple. Just PHP.

Organization info
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
people are 'users' (meta info in usermeta)
teams are 'working_teams'. For now getting team members search all usermeta/teams. future optimization: create serialized array of users in the working_teams.
projects are 'projects'. For now getting team members search all usermeta/projects. future optimization: create serialized array of users in the working_projects.
companies are 'company'.
all_workers - if company manager: all members. if team(s) manager: all team members. otherwise null;

classes Org_Company, Org_Team, Org_Worker, Org_Project in org folder.
