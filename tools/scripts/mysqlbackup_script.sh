# GoDaddy Linux Hosting this is  the same as the DBUSERNAME

# Path of the folder where backups will be stored. $HOME/html will
# automatically put you in the hosting accounts root folder. GoDaddy MySQL 
# databases are normally stored in the _db_backups folder within your base 
# hosting folder. If the folder does not exist create it before running the 
# script. You can also create a subfolder within _db_backups folder if you 
# would like to backup the database to a separate folder. Alternatively, 
# you can backup to an entirely different folder of your choice. Whatever 
# you choose to do, ensure that the path is correctly specified below.

# Should the script delete older files based on the conditions you set 
# below (Y or N - uppercase letters only). Choosing Y will maintain only
# recent backups based on your settings below. Choosing N will keep all
# the backups from the past.

# Do daily backups Y or N? (one uppercase letter only)

# Number of recent daily backups to keep. The default is 6 (Sun-Fri) with 
# Weekly backup on Sat.All previous backups will be deleted. This is 
# meaningless unless DAILYBACKUP is set to Y.

# Do weekly backups Y or N? (one uppercase letter only). Weekly backups
# are done on Saturdays.

# Number of recent weekly backups to keep. The default is 4. All previous 
# weekly backups will be deleted. This is meaningless unless WEEKLYBACKUP 
# is set to Y.

# are done on the last day of the month.

# Number of recent monthly backups to keep. The default is 2. All previous
