Sharing code between plugins.
In develop, core library is linked between the projects. Fresh is the main, and others link includes/core to fresh.
In runtime - wp-setting loads the plugins. Core libraries appear in each of them. require_once doesn't helps. We'll check
!class_exists (or function_exists).
